# Problem 6: Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
## Time complexity
We must find both max and min values in the array in O(n), which is rather trivial. We can accomplish that in a single traversal.
## Space complexity
It is possible to solve this problem just by keeping track of both max and min values, without any additional data structure, and so with a constant space complexity O(1).
