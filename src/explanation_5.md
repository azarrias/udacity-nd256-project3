# Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries
## Time complexity
Time complexity of creating a trie is O(W*L), where W is the number of words and L the average length of words. Insertions and lookups have the same complexity.
## Space complexity
Space complexity would also be O(W*L), which gives an upper bound, because it does not consider common prefixes.
