# Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer
## Time complexity
Given the expected time complexity of O(logn) and that we need the floor value, we should be able to solve this problem through binary search.
## Space complexity
The problem is solved in-place, thus space complexity is reduced to constant O(1).
